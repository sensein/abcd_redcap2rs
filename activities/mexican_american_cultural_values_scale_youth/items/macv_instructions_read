But sometimes, because there are big or more complicated words, this works better if i read them.\r\n\r\nLet's have a shot at you reading and then we'll try it the other way.  Ok?\r\n\r\nHere's the first questionnaire, let's start by you reading it out loud and filling in the answers on your own......RA to still read instructions and answering format on MACV"
