        "en": "Next I will measure your blood pressure using this machine. You may have had this done before. First, I will measure your arm so I can choose the appropriate cuff that will go around your arm. When I turn on the machine you'll feel a little pressure like this (RA to demonstrate).I will take your blood pressure 3 times in a row, with a minute break between each measurement. Please uncross your legs and sit with your feet flat on the floor and place your palm facing up on the table. Just sit as quietly and still as you can when the machine is running.Ready?RA Reminders:\r\n1. Select correct cuff size for participant.\r\n4. Confirm settings on OMRON (F1 - 3; F2 - 00, 00; F3 - 01, 00)For full SOP, please click here"
