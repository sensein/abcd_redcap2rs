        "en": "Total yearly energy expenditure (in minutes), calculated by multiplying the minutes spent per year in each of the 23 sports by the sport-specific metabolic equivalent of task (MET) and summing across the 23 sports. This value was multiplied by the sex- and weight-specific basal metabolic rate from Schofield equations to yield the total energy expenditure. See the release notes for the task specific METs. Note: dividing this value by 3120 (60 minutes times 52 weeks) provides total energy expenditure in hours/week."
