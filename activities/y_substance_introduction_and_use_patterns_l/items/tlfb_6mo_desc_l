        "en": "INTERVIEWER:If they used any of the above drugs since the last assessment- then administer TLFB to cover time since last assessment. Pull up the most recent phone interview completed and note which substances were reported and approximately when- remind participant of these incidents to assist with memory.\"Ok, now I want to closely measure how much of the drugs you have used since we last saw on [asnt_timestamp_c]. You said you have used:(list drugs)_______during this time. So now we are going to measure that use more closely. \n\nThis will not be too hard of a task, because I am going to help you use a calendar like this one{orient to calendar}. What the calendar does is give you a picture of the dates and patterns of your substance use...What we have found is that calendars are very useful in helping people recall their drug or alcohol use. The idea is to record the amount of{fill in drug}in standard amounts you have used on each day, week or month.  For example, if you drank alcohol we would measure in drinks, such as a 12 oz can of beer, or a 5 oz glass of wine- and I will show you pictures and help you measure. We will go back approximately one year month by month, then for any remaining time we will focus on your typical or average use.  If you cannot remember exact details, then we will record your typical use for that month.\n\nTHE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WE WRITE SOMETHING ON EACH MONTH OF THE CALENDAR. ... Next I want to see if there were any really important dates since the last assessment, such as holidays, vacations, special sporting events, birthdays or other parties that may help you recall your drug or alcohol use.Interviewer: Fill in these dates under events so they can help with memory of drugs used.Great, let's start with {first drug}, how many times would you say you've used { first drug }? For example, a few times this year, every other month, monthly, weekly, a few times a week. \n\n-Ok, how about {second drug}, how many times would you say you've used { second drug }?\n\n-Ok, how about {third drug}, how many times would you say you've used { third drug }?{Do for rest of drugs}Ok, great. We will start going through the calendar and I will show you pictures of ways to measure each drug. \n\nWhen is the last time you used { first drug }? When is the last time you used { second drug }? \nWhen is the last time you used {third drug }?{Do for rest of drugs}Let's start with { first drug }, we will measure that by {explain standard measurement such as standard drinks, grams for smoked MJ, occasions for most drugs}?Interviewer:Detailed TLFB: Last 12 months.Take out the appropriate Standard Unit slides and show the participant each drug picture, and ask how they typically use the drug. Get them oriented on how we will measure the drugs. Then go week by week or month by month (depending on their pattern) through the first 12 months. Remember TIPS below.Estimated TLFB: For periods >12 months,get their general pattern (number of occasions per month, average number of standard units per occasion). The important thing for that time-period is to capture general pattern; we will not be measuring co-use days or weekday vs. weekend information.Click here to open the TLFB Calendar in ABCD Reports.TLFB TIPS:\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 You will need: scrap pieces of paper (shred after), calculator, and standard unit slides\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Ask how they use each substance (especially alcohol, marijuana, nicotine) & about how often they use them to get a sense of their pattern before starting.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 For first 12 months, try to get accurate information going back month by month.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 If they cannot remember specific dates, have them give best guess. Try to differentiate weekend vs. weekday use.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Fractions of standard units are allowable.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Try to be accurate about co-use (e.g., did they use alcohol and MJ on the same days- doesn't matter what the date is, but try to put the events on the same days). \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 If someone has a general pattern, you can use that, but BEFORE entering, ask if there were any days or time-periods that month where they had substantially more or less than what was typical. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Click on an event in the calendar to erase it.\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 If entering a repeated event- make SURE to check the box \"limit range by days of the week\" AND pick the days (e.g., click on Friday/Saturday to reflect weekend drinking; click on each day to reflect daily smoking). If you make a mistake on a repeated event, you will have to erase each single event- so to be safe, only do repeated events for 1-2 months max. \n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 This is a flexible interview- you can fill out regularly used drugs first, then fill in less frequently used drugs. If there is a lot of co-use (e.g., they typically drink and smoke), then fill those out together month to month. ESTIMATED period >12 months: if need to fill out beyond 12 months, then hit \"ESTIMATE\" button and fill in average number of occasions (all substances) and average number of standard units (for alcohol, marijuana, nicotine)."
