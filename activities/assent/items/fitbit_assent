First, I'll talk to you about all that will happen during your visit with us. I'll give you the chance to ask questions and then I'll ask you if you want to be in this study.(RA should thoroughly review the assent document in detail. It is okay to paraphrase. Ensure that Assent document is fully completed and that they know they can change their mind about participating).Do you have any questions?RA: If appointment a remote visit due toCOVID-19, obtainverbalassent from youth"
