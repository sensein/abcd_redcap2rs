First, I'll talk to you about all that will happen during your visit with us. I'll give you the chance to ask questions and then I'll ask you if you want to be in this study.(RA should thoroughly review the assent document in detail. It is okay to paraphrase. Ensure that Assent document is fully completed and that they know they can change their mind about participating)."

        "en": "INTRO TO VISITIf child agrees to participate, say:Okay, so we will be doing a number of different things today. You will play some iPad games and answer some questions. Some will be easy, some will be hard, we just ask that you try your best. If you don't know the answer, it's okay to say 'I don't know.' We will take several breaks throughout your time with us so you can rest and have snacks.If using the coin system:Every time you finish one of these games today, you will earn coins to put in a bucket. You are trying to earn 30 coins today and at the end of the day, you get to trade those coins in for prizes. Prizes are worth 30 coins each* (or 15 each if you want to offer two small prizes as well).\r\n\r\nDo you have any questions? Ready to get started?"
