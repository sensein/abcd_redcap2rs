Using this tag along with an image that has been mapped (various areas of the image have been made selectable), you can allow the user to select areas within the image, and have those selections map to checkbox selections.\r\n\r\nCurrently, this tag requires custom programming if you want to use it for any general image.  \r\n\r\nThis example instrument contains image maps of the male and female human form, complete with custom coding, so you may use a copy of this instrument in your projects without any additional coding.\r\n\r\nIn the example below, you can select either the male or female form, then select one or more parts of the image.\r\n\r\nMore information about this custom action tag can be foundin the Knowledgebase."
