        "en": "Ok, now I want to measure how much of the drugs you have used in the past six months. You said you have used: _____________________ during the last six months.\n\nThis will not be too hard of a task, because I am going to help you use a calendar like this one {orient to calendar}.  What the calendar does is give you a picture of the dates and patterns of your substance use...\n\n...What we have found is that calendars are very useful in helping people recall their drug or alcohol use. The idea is to record the amount of {fill in drug} in standard amounts you have used on each day.  For example, if you drank alcohol we would measure in drinks, such as a 12 oz can of beer, or a 5 oz glass of wine- but, I will show you pictures and help you measure. \n\nIf you cannot remember exact details, then we will record your typical use for that week. THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT WE WRITE SOMETHING ON EACH MONTH OF THE CALENDAR...\n\nNext I want to see if there were any really important dates in the past six months, such as holidays, vacations, special sporting events, birthdays or other parties that may help you recall your drug or alcohol use.Interview: Fill in these dates so they can help with memory of drugs used.Great, next I will show you pictures of ways to measure each drug and please let me know how you use the drug.Interviewer: Show the participant each drug picture, and ask how they typically use the drug. Get them oriented on how we will measure the drugs."
