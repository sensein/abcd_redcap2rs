        "en": "The next set of questions are about alcohol, cigarettes and other drugs.  Do you know what drugs are? Drugs are substances that can look like pills, powders or cigarettes that change the way people feel, think, and behave. Some drugs are medicines that are legal, which means you get them from a doctor or buy them at a store or pharmacy. But sometimes people take drugs just to change how they feel. I'm going to ask if you have heard of some different drugs. Remember: I won't tell anyone what you tell me - not even your parent(s), unless I find out that somebody might be getting hurt in some way.Interviewer -onlyshow pictures if participantUSED the substance.Do NOTshow pictures during the \"heard of\" questions.)"
