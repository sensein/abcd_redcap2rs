        "en": "Interviewer: determine typical average number of standard caffeine (use typical serving)drinks per week in the past six months. If they drink less than weekly, then input the fraction representing weekly use. For example, if someone has 2 coffees a month the math would be 2/4 because there are 4 weeks in one month, the answer is 0.5 per week- so enter \"0.5\". If they had 1 coffee per month it would be 1/4=\"0.25. If someone only had 1 coffee in past 6 months it would be 1/24 because there are 24 weeks in 6 months= the answer is \".04\"; this is the smallest possible answer. \n \nPlease do NOT write any words, such as oz, cup, etc. in your answer- only include the appropriate number."
