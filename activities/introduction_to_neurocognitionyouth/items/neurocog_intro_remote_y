After each question let me know the answer you think is best and I will select it for you on my iPad. Some are easy and some are more difficult. Don't worry if you make mistakes - everyone does. Try your hardest, working accurately and quickly. Some questions may take more time than others, and that's ok; just do your best on each one. Please remember to sit up nice and straight!\u00e2\u0080\u00a8\u00e2\u0080\u00a8\r\n\r\nI will let you know when you can take a break, if you want one.
