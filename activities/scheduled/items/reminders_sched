We'd like to send you a link, so you can complete some questionnaires, about 20-30 minutes' worth, before your appointment, at your leisure.  This link can be sent by email or text. This is not required, and if you decide to try it but don't get a chance or don't finish, no problem. You are welcome to complete any or all of these forms here during your appointment too.  These questions will save time from the parent's portion of the in-person visit, not your child's duration. Would you like me to send you a link to these questions you can do at home before your appointment (if so, please verify parent's email address/phone number)?\""
