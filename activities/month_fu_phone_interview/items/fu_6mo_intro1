        "en": "Hi(name of child), this is(your name)from the ABCD study!\r\n\r\nDo you remember coming to(name of study site)to see us last(month that child participated in baseline)? Today, I have some questions that we ask everyone about 6 months after their initial visit. \r\n\r\nSame as last time, I'd like to remind you that I won't tell anyone what you tell me during this interview. You can talk to your parents about what we talked about, but we will not share any thing you tell us with anyone outside our study. This means that we do not share anything you tell us with your parents or your school or anyone else. The only reasons we would have to share this information are: if you tell us that you plan to really hurt yourself(pause), if you tell us that you plan to really hurt another person(pause), or if we learn that a child or elder has been abused. Do you have any questions?\r\n\r\nBecause this telephone interview must be private, please make sure that we are not on speaker so that others cannot hear our conversation.\r\n\r\nBefore I begin asking questions, I want to make sure that you are alone, in a quiet place where you will not be disturbed.  Are you in a place where you can speak privately right now?"
