This should only take about 10 minutes and we ask that you complete this in one sitting.\n\nAs always, we would like to remind you that we will not share anything you tell us with anyone outside our study. This means that we do not share anything you tell us with your parents or your school or anyone else. The only reasons we would have to share this information are: if you tell us that you plan to really hurt yourself, if you tell us that you plan to really hurt another person, or if we learn that a child or elder has been abused.\n\nBecause we want to make sure you feel comfortable answering all the questions, we want to make sure you are in a quiet place where you will not be disturbed. Are you in a place where this is possible?"
