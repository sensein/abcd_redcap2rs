        "en": "If you're ready, we will start setting up the phone app now. A few things to keep in mind:\r\n\r\nIt is important that you leave the application on the device for the next 21 days\r\n\r\nYou don't need to do anything different to have the data collected; just use your device normally, including the newly installed keyboard, and make sure the device is charged\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, the app cannot know what you are looking at, what websites you visit, or any content you post or view. The app is not collecting geographic or mobility data from Google Maps, Waze, or other types of apps that provide directions.\r\n\r\nWe'll be in touch with you if the device isn't syncing with our encrypted cloud servers\r\n\r\nAfter 21 days of data has been collected, we will contact you and ask you to uninstall the application\u00e2\u0080\u00a8\r\n\r\nYou will receive a link for a quick questionnaire, one for both the parent and one for the child, that we ask you to complete within a week.\u00e2\u0080\u00a8\r\n\r\nYou will receive $10 after we receive the questionnaires and confirmation that the applications have been removed from the device. We will give you a sheet with all of this information, too. Do you have any questions?"
