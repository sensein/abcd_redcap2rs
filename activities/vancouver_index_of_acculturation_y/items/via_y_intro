        "en": "Many of these questions will refer to your heritage culture/culture of origin, meaning the original culture of your family (other than the culture of America or the United States).  It may be the culture of your birth, the culture in which you have been raised, or any socio-cultural group which influenced your family background.  If there are several, pick the one that has influenced you most (for example: Irish, Chinese, Latino, Mexican, Cuban, Puerto-Rican, Black or African-American, Native-American or American Indian, Jewish, Amish, Latter-day Saints/Mormon).\r\n\r\nIf you do not feel that you have been influenced by any other culture, please name a culture that influenced previous generations of your family, or you may choose \"none\" if you do not identify with a cultural heritage other than American."
