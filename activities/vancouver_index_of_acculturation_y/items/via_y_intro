If there are several, pick the one you feel most connected to. A few examples from a long list of choices are Hispanic/Latino, African American/Black, Asian, Jewish, and Latter-day Saints/Mormon. If you do not feel connected to any other culture, please name a culture that has influenced other generations of your family, or you may choose \"none\" if you do not feel connected with a heritage culture other than American.\r\n \r\nPlease pick one of the numbers to the right of each question to indicate how much you agree or disagree with each statement."
